•	Why: to enable device communication, data transfer, exports, updates, or remote services as configured by the user.

E. Diagnostic / App Usage Data (Optional)
•	What: crash logs, performance data, basic device/app info (e.g., OS version).
•	Why: to improve stability and fix bugs.

## How We Use Information
We use the information described above to:
•	provide photogrammetry capture features and project workflows,

•	Location — to geotag captures and support survey/mapping features.
•	Bluetooth / Nearby Devices — to scan for, pair with, and connect to supported external devices.
•	Network / Internet Access (non-runtime on many platforms) — to connect via TCP/IP to devices or services, and to transfer data when requested.
You can deny permissions. Some features may not work without them.

## Sharing and Disclosure
